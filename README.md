# uASPIre_UTR_CDS

This repository contains the data of _**u**ltradeep **A**cquisition of **S**equence-**P**henotype **I**nter**re**lations_ (uASPIre) and the code for processing raw NGS data as presented in the manuscript "Ultradeep characterisation of translational sequence determinants refutes rare-codon hypothesis and unveils quadruplet base pairing of initiator tRNA and transcript".


## Organization of the repository

1. [**data**](data) contains the data required to reproduce all figures in the main text. Due to file size limitations, data is gzipped into multiple subfiles.


## Hardware requirements
This code package requires a Unix system with >10 GB RAM and optimally multiple cores.


## Software requirements
The code runs on Unix systems only, and was developed and tested on R version 4.2.1 running on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server (release 7.9).


## Installation
No installation is needed, the code can be run as is.


## Software dependencies
This code requires the following UNIX tools and packages:
